            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Worthy Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT may perhaps be thought an high Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (eſpecially by ſuch that judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well done, but what they have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to do themſelves) for me that may be accounted the leaſt of all men, able to put my ſelf to ſuch a publick Cenſure of thoſe moſt Learned and great Proficients in this <hi>Honourable</hi> and moſt <hi>Noble Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, becauſe I would not hide my Talent that the Lord hath given to me, and ſo be termed an unprofitable Servant, having through the wonderful goodneſs of God, found out thoſe and ſuch like Remedies, and that by a diligent Care, and long Study, have had thereof large Experience, <hi>(which is the Daughter of Time, the Mother of Wiſdom, the true Rewarder of Travel, though the Jewel
<pb facs="tcp:93677:4"/>of a few)</hi> and not doubting but that they will prove very profitable, not only to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed Patient, but to the young Student in Phyſick; for whoſe ſakes I could by no means neglect the Publication hereof.</p>
            <p>Another, and the moſt principal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was from a ſerious Conſideration of the Great Neceſſity, and Lamentable Miſery that I daily behold, ſome of the meaner ſort of people, being intollerably tormented with <hi>moſt dangerous and grievous diſtempers,</hi> and muſt abſolutely periſh having not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to be at great Charges in long and tedious courſes of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Neither to give to old <hi>Dives</hi> his large fee before-hand, without which he will not put his foot into the Styrup, nor his horſes in the Coach.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons ſeriouſly conſidered, were the abſolute Motives to force me more to the publiſhing of this ſmall, and I hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Honeſt Engliſh Man</hi> may reap thereby the greater Benefit, I have purpoſely omitted all Philoſophical, Eloquent, and hard crabbed words, <hi>(though not Ignorant thereof)</hi> which more affright the honeſt and harmleſs <hi>Patient,</hi> then Cure his languiſhing <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93677:4"/>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding the real and beſt of my Endeavours to promote the Intereſt of my Countrymen, and to do them ſervice, in giving them ſome certain Rules how to help themſelves in times of Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Black mouth'd Envy, that ſeverely Barkes though, cannot Bite, will ſtill Snarle, and look upon me with a ſquint Eye, as if I had done ſome Injuſtice to the very Laws of Friendſhip, and common Society.</p>
            <p>And the grand Reaſons are, that my Pills in the Dropſie, have wrought more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects then any other Medicines yet have done.</p>
            <p>Since which time, to defraud the Ignorant, every fracturated fellow in their Pamplets pretend to Cure the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> though it be but with Aloes, and Sena, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> infuſed in Brandy, and the Lungs of an Oxe applied to the Belly, which prepoſterous Courſes have of late killed many, ſome of good worth.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome of the fore-mentioned will be apt to Judge that I have publiſhed this Treatiſe purpoſely to promote my own Intereſt, becauſe I have in ſome Chapters made mention of my <hi>Cathartique</hi> and <hi>Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Pills;</hi> in anſwer to which, I will aſſure the Reader I have not made mention thereof
<pb facs="tcp:93677:5"/>but where they are abſolutely neceſſary, and I queſtion not, but thoſe that are acquainted with me and them, will believe that what I have here imparted, is to the utmoſt of my power really to promote the well-fare of my Country, and not my own Intereſt, <hi>(Which in Duty to God and Man I am bound to do)</hi> this being firſt intended not for private uſe, but for a publick good.</p>
            <p>So not valuing the Threats of ſome of the ſame faculty, knowing the ſnares they have laid for others, themſelves will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in: When I ſhall be from their rigid Malice ſhelter'd under the Wings of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and there live above the Praiſe or Diſpraiſe of Men.</p>
            <p>But yet muſt humbly acknowledge my ſelf, <hi>Dear Countrey-men,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Falling Sickneſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Falling Sickneſs is a Convulſion, or for the moſt part a praeternatural motion of the whole body, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly depriveth the Patient both of Reaſon and Senſe.</p>
               <p>There are three differences in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <p>The firſt is cauſed when this Diſeaſe cometh only through the diſeaſe in the Brain, as it falleth out, when ſharp Choler, or groſs and tough Flegm doth obſtruct the paſſage of the Spirit in the Ventricle of the Brain; and if this diſtemper cometh of a groſs humour, it doth ſuddenly ſeize upon the Patient, and is quickly gone again.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Cauſe is through an evil affect in the Orifice of the Stomack, that may be when the Brain laboureth to expel the Vapours that ariſe up to it from the Stomack.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93677:23"/>
               <p>The third cauſe is from Vapours which, aſcend by conſent from moſt parts of the Body, or elſe from ſome particular Member, which the Patient may perceive like to cold Air creeping up to the Brain, but this doth but ſeldom happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſigns of the Falling ſickneſs are many;</hi> in ſome ſadneſs and forgetfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in others a fooliſh ſtate both of Body and Mind; troubleſome dreams; the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach; and fullneſs in it; more eſpecially in paſſion or anger, the Face commonly pale, and the motion of the Tongue inordinate, and oftentimes they bite it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this Diſeaſe ſeizeth upon the Patient, he falls down and is plucked up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he ſnorts, and ſometimes cries out, many tremble and turn round. The only ſign of this Diſeaſe is foaming at the Mouth, which happens moſt to Children and young people.</p>
               <p>In the fit of the Falling Sickneſs, as ſoon as the Patient falleth down, open his Mouth with a ſtick, the haft of a Knife, or with the handle of a Spoon, and after his Mouth is made clean by taking away the foam with a Rag or Feather, give him to drink the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Julip.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93677:23"/>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Apoplexie.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AN Apoplexie is a ſudden privation both of the Senſe and Motion of the Body, and an interruption of the Animal Functions.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Apoplexies,</hi> the one ſtrong, the other more mild; the ſtrong is a moſt ſharp Diſtemper, and ſtrangleth a Man forthwith, (or if not preſently prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, turneth to a <hi>Palſey</hi>) and is ſeldom cured.</p>
               <p>But the milder ſort is curable; for in it both Motion and Senſe remain, but both very ſtupid heavy, and exceeding dull.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of the <hi>Apoplexie</hi> is (too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in theſe dayes) drunkenneſs, falls from high places, blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Flegmatick Humours which doth fill and obſtruct at one time the principal Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain; very cold Air which congeals or thickens the moiſt Excrements of the Brain, is alſo oftentimes the cauſe of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93677:29"/>this diſtemper, and it frequently cometh through groſs melancholy humours.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms or Signs of this deadly diſtemper, are violent pains in the Head, ſwelling of the Neck Veins, a Vertigo, and a brightneſs or a kind of glittering before their Eyes, panting of the Body, a coldneſs of the extream parts, without any cauſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, dull and ſlow in motion, and in ſleep oftentimes gnaw their Teeth, their Urine lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in quantity, and black, much like to Ruſt, and the Canker in Mettals, and hath a ſetling in the bottom like to flower.</p>
               <p>Such that are troubled with the <hi>Apoplexie</hi> have not always evil Symptoms perceived before hand, but fall down ſuddenly as if they were ſtruck with Thunder, and they lie with their Eyes faſtned, and ſnort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſe, Motion or Underſtanding, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the dead only by Breathing, and that with much difficulty.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe for the moſt part happens to old men that are decrepit, and of a Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Complexion, and to the great drinkers of Brandy, and decayed Wine, too much made uſe of in theſe dayes, were the Truth known.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93677:29"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cure</hi> of the milder ſort of <hi>Apoplexie</hi> may be performed as followeth.</p>
               <p>If the Cure be not too deſperate in ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick or full Bodies, where ſtrength will permit, open the Cephalick Veins; but take not away too much blood at a time, but rather at ſeveral times: I have often ſeen the Jugular Veins on both ſides the Neck open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not without wonderfull ſucceſs: However bleeding ought not to be attempted without very good advice.</p>
               <p>But give to the Patient the Gliſter made as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Lavender, Hyſop. Pennyroyal, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, Marjoram, Betony, Rue, Origan, Sage, of each half a handfull, Seeds of Fennel, Carawayes, Seſelis Agarick, Pollipody, Pulp of Colocynthis, of each two Drams:</hi> cut and bruiſe them, and boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Water, to the conſumption of half, then ſtrain it, and to one Pint of the ſtrained Liquor; <hi>add thereto Sal Gemme one Dram and a half, Hiera Picra one Ounce and a half, Oyl of Rue, Caſtor and Bay-berries, of each half an Ounce, the Extract of black Hellebor one Scruple;</hi> mix them altogether, and make a Gliſter thereof.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93677:30"/>
               <p>Or, <hi>Take hard Honey, half an Ounce, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium half a Scruple, the Powder of Colocin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thys twenty Grains, Sal Gemma two Scruples;</hi> boil them together, and make Suppoſitories thereof, and fix Threads thereto, that after they are put up into the Fundament, you may draw them forth at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When you have done thus, provoke the Patient to Sneeſe with the following Powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Pellitory of</hi> Spain, <hi>Marjoram, white Hellebor, of each half a Scruple, Euphorbium and Caſtor, of each five Grains;</hi> being made into fine Powder, ſnuff it up into the Noſtrils, or blow it up through a Quill, but a little at a time.</p>

               <p>For it is moſt wonderfully effectual in the Fit of the <hi>Vertigo, Falling Sickneſs,</hi> and <hi>Apoplexie,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93677:30"/>
               <p>In places where ſuch ingredients cannot be ſoon obtained; take Nutmeg, Ginger and ſweet Marjoram, or Ginger alone, and blow it up into the Noſtils, as afore directed.</p>
               <p>Or let the Patient ſmell to <hi>Galbauum Caſtor, Opoponax,</hi> or <hi>Sagapenum;</hi> which will be a means to raiſe and ſtir him up.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Palſey.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Palſey is a diſtemper wherein the one half of the Body, either the right or left doth loſe both Senſe and Motion, and then it may be called a general Palſey. But ſometimes it hapneth in one Member only, as in the Head, the Tongue, the Hand, and the Yard, Leg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Palſey ſometimes Senſe is only loſt, and ſometimes Motion alone, and at other times both Senſe and Motion.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this Diſeaſe is through abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of groſs, tough and clammy Humours, which obſtruct or ſtop the Sinews, hindering the Animal faculty, that it cannot come from the Fountain to the Members. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is cauſed through immoderate Cold, at other times through exceſſive heat or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation; or by ſome Schirrus or hardneſs in the Back bone, or in the parts adjacent, or in other Sinewy parts over much preſſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93677:32"/>or cruſhed; by which means the Animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty cannot paſs: Many times it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through a Feaver, and that principally ingendred of melancholy, poſſeſſing the mind, and changing the temperature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: It is frequently cauſed three manner of ways, ſometimes of Melancholy it ſelf, and ſometimes by the alteration of the Blood in the Brain, and through inflammation and evil affect of the Stomack and Sides.</p>
               <p>The ſigns of the Palſey are many, as ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fearfulneſs, envy, hatred, ſtrange fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies or imaginations,</p>
               <p>This is no acute Diſeaſe, but Chronical, or of long continuance, and for the moſt part curable, eſpecially in young people, or when the paralitick Member doth not become leſs, or change his Colour; for if ſo, it is hardly curable.</p>
               <p>In this Diſtemper his Diet ought to be ſlender and drying, and for the firſt two or three days let him altogether abſtain, or be content with Broath made of Barley unhusk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or with Mede, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after let him have Meat of good Juice, and of light digeſtion, and that well Roaſted. Let him eat Partridge, Larks, and ſuch like, <hi>Pine-nuts,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93677:33"/>Let him take of <hi>Savory, Sage, Parſley, Fennel, Hyſop</hi> and <hi>Marjoram.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And forbear all things that are cold and moiſt, as Fiſh, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and drink ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, except of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> wherein is boiled <hi>Sage</hi> and <hi>Cinamon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or of the drink made as followeth.</p>
               <p>Take Gallingal, long Pepper, Nutmegs, Cloves and Mace, of each one Dram, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moms one Dram and a half, Ginger half an Ounce, the beſt Cinamon two Ounces; boil them altogether in three or four Quarts of running Water, to the conſumption of half, then ſtrain it, and add thereto eight Ounces of the beſt Sugar, and drink thereof a ſmall quantity at a time firſt and laſt.</p>
               <p>In the time of Cure drink no Brandy; neither any other ſtrong Spirits of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Alſo forbear Wine, except a ſmall quantity towards the latter end of the Cure. Exerciſe and motion is good, alſo mirth; ſleep in the night, but not in the day.</p>
               <p>The Cure ought to be began with Blood-letting, if age and ſtrength will permit; (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where fullneſs abounds) but it ought to be taken away with moderation, leaſt the Body ſhould be over much cooled, and alſo obſerve to open the Veins on the well and

               <p>Of which there are three ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is called in <hi>Latine Diſtentio;</hi> and that is when the Neck doth remain altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without motion, and not to be turned to either ſide; but muſt be held upright.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is called <hi>Tenſio ad Anteriora,</hi> in which Diſeaſe the Head and Neck are drawn down to the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The third is called <hi>Tenſio ad Poſteriora;</hi> in which Diſtemper the Head is attracted or drawn backward down to the Shoulders and Back.</p>

               <p>IN the Noſe are ſeveral diſtempers, as filthy rotten ſtinking Ulcers, cauſed through corrupt ſharp and ſalt humors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleeding at the Noſe proving deſtructive to many, is oftentimes <hi>outwardly</hi> cauſed by Falls, Blows, or by violent <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> or heat of the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Polypus is a fleſhy matter growing in the Noſtrils, cauſed through groſs humors falling to the ſame, and oftentimes it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through a melancholly humour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Noſe is alſo affected with putrid or rotten Ulcers. Cauſed by the <hi>French Pox,</hi> or Venerial ſports.</p>
               <p>For the cure of deep and rotten Ulcers in the Noſe, called <hi>Ozene,</hi> take the juice of <hi>Calamint,</hi> and with a feather put it up into the noſtrils, or blow the powder of the ſame therein with a quil, or anoint the noſtrils with honey, which will bring them to a ſcurf or ſcab, that will fall of in four or five days, and when they are fallen of <hi>take the oyntment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93677:53"/>of Roſes and anoint the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers therewith,</hi> and the more to Cleanſe the ſame, diſſolve <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum</hi> in Barly water, and ſyring the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, or ſnuff it up therein.</p>
               <p>Or anoint them with the juice of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats boyled firſt in a Braſen Veſſel to the conſumption of half.</p>

               <p>Or take Sugar of Lead diſſolved in Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain water, and ſyring the noſtrills which will both dry and heal.</p>
               <p>Or make tents of dried <hi>Gentian,</hi> and put them up into the noſtrils, for they will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or open themſelves. <hi>Then take ſalt of Gemme two drams, Maſtick and Frankinſence of each one dram.</hi> Being made into powder, add thereto the juice of <hi>Celandine</hi> one ounce, oyle <hi>Olive</hi> half a pint, and let them be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an ointment, after which anoint the tents therewith, putting them up as afore directed.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes with a feather touch the Ulcers with ſtrong Vinegar, wherein is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the powder of <hi>Album Graecum;</hi> if after all this there remain pains in the noſtrills, <hi>Take oyle of Mirtles, Roſes, of each an ounce,

               <p>In the cure of theſe Ulcers, and ſuch like, in the beginning the head ought to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and dried, becauſe they often happen through corrupt humors flowing from the head to the noſtrils, ſo in the firſt place ſhave the Head, and apply thereto the Plaſter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Emplaſtrum Stephaniaion, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THe Tooth-Ach is cauſed ſeveral ways, either from a flux of humours cold and flegmy, or hot and watry, ſharp and ſalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thoſe humours deflux to the Membranes of the Jaws, and to the holes wherein the Teeth are, and to the Nerve placed in the root of the Jaw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes the pain in the Teeth is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through inflammation of the Gums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when a ſwelling riſeth upon the Gums or Jaws, the pain of the Teeth ceaſe. Much more might be ſaid as touching the pains of the Teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which here I muſt omit.</p>
               <p>If the pain comes of hot humours, open a Vein on the ſame-ſide in the Arm: but if the pain come through cold, bleeding will not be profitable.</p>

               <p>Or take of the beſt Opium and Bees Wax of each a like quantity, and work it well together before the fire with your fingers, wherewith mix a ſmall quantity of Lint and put it up into the hollow Tooth: for if the pain come of heat, it will give preſent eaſe, and cureth in a ſhort time. If the pain come through cold, take Sugar and Pepper beat in fine Powder, being melted together in a Braſs, Copper, or Silver Ladle, and made up in round Balls while hot, held between the Teeth, gives preſent eaſe.</p>

               <p>THe Ulcers of the Mouth, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through ſharp and ſalt Humours, or of Vapours from ſeveral parts aſcending to the Jaws.</p>
               <p>They often happen to thoſe that have hot Livers, or malignant Feavers; and to ſuch that are tormented with Venereal diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Age and ſtrength will permit, this Cure ought to be began with Blood-letting, for it draweth back the humours, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth their ſharpneſs by cooling the Body.</p>
               <p>You may alſo apply Horſe-leeches behind the Ears, and under the Chin, and Bliſtering Plaſters to the Neck-pit, and the next day after Bleeding, and as need ſhall require, purge with my Cathartique and Diuretique Pills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for they beyond any, doth expel ſharp, ſalt humors, and alſo the evil and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Humours offending the Noſe, Mouth, and Throat, too often cauſed by Mercurial
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93677:61"/>Medicines) after which make uſe of the Gargariſm made as followeth.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And if there be no Inflamation, you may touch the Ulcer with a ſtick with a ragg tied to the end thereof dipt firſt in the Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol, and it helps forthwith, if the Ulcer be ſimple; but to Children, mix with theſe Spirits Honey of Roſes, ſo that it may be but a

               <p>
                  <hi>Or take the juice of Houſleek, and freſh Cream, mix them well together, and anoint your Mouth therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Mouth and Almonds are ſo much Ulcerated, that the Patient cannot ſwallow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take the diſtilled water of Elder-flowers, Plantane-water, and the water diſtilled from the Black-Thorn-flowers, of each alike, diſſolve therein as much Venus ſope as a Walnut, ſweeten it with a ſmall quantity of the Syrup of Mulberries, and gargle the Mouth often therewith, if theſe take not effect, add to either of the Gargariſms a ſmall quantity of Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum, and gargle therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another excellent remedy for the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Mouth and Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Quinzy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Quinzy</hi> is an Inflamation of the Throat and Jaws, of which there are (according to Authors) four ſorts:</p>
               <p>The firſt is when the Jaws are inflamed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is when neither the Jaws nor other parts either inward or outward are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and yet the Patient in danger of choaking.</p>
               <p>The third is when the inward and outward parts about the Throat are inflamed.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, when the Joynts between the Head and Neck are looſened, and the part appear hollow, and the Patient ſenſible of pain when but touched.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Quinzy</hi> is cauſed through ſome flux of Humours which fall from the Head to the Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from abundance of Blood preternaturally flowing to the foreſaid parts; and ſometimes it may be cauſed from vapours ariſing from the Stomack to the Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Quinzy</hi> is known by the Signs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93677:63"/>
               <p>The Patient breathes with much difficulty, except the Neck be held upright, and can hardly ſwallow without violent pain.</p>
               <p>In ſome there appears redneſs in the face and Neck, and a Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſtemper often kills in four and twenty hours.</p>
               <p>Therefore without delay open a Vein in the Arm upon the ſame ſide, or open the Vein under the Tongue. Some with good ſncceſs open the Jugular Veins. But take not the Blood forth at once, but at ſeveral times, leſt the Patient faint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Inciſion be ſomewhat large, leſt the thinner part of the Blood come forth, and leave the groſſer part behind, which is many times the abſolute Cauſe of this deadly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <p>If the Patient be of the <hi>Female Sex,</hi> open the Vein in the Anckles; more eſpecially if her <hi>Monthly Sickneſs</hi> be obſtructed.</p>

               <p>Or inſtead thereof let him take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Potion:</p>

               <p>DIfficulty of Breathing is commonly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a Flegmatick Humour which falls from the Head to the Lungs, and ſtops the Winde-pipe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And often times by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Humors conveighed into the Lungs, (as in hydropical perſons) cauſeth an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or difficulty of Breathing.</p>
               <p>As touching the Cure of this Diſeaſe, (Eſpecially in Hydropical and Scorbutical Conſtitutions)</p>
               <p>In the firſt place make uſe of my <hi>Cathartique and Diuretique Pills,</hi> for they do not only make thin and cleanſe, but perfectly expel all tough and groſs humours which (for the moſt part) ingender this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or take of the choiſeſt Agarick two drams, Ginger one ſcruple, Salt Gem three grains; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groſly beaten, infuſe them all night in two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſweet White-Wine, and the diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fennel and Wormwood, of each one ounce,

               <p>
                  <hi>Pills of Cochia and Agarick, and Pills of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era Picra made up with Honey,</hi> are alſo very profitable in ſuch caſes. Sometimes ſtrong Gliſters will be of excellent uſe.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding making uſe of the aforeſaid Medicines, (eſpecially upon the intermitting days) take of the following <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> for to my knowledge it is of excellent uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take the Diſtilled Water of Scabios, ſmall Cinamon-Water, of each three ounces, Syrup of Liquoriſh, Syrup of Hoarhound, Oxymel of Squills, and Lohoch Sanum, of each one ounce, Spirit or Oyl of Vitriol twenty drops;</hi> mix them well together, and make a Julip thereof, which take one or two Spoonfuls firſt and laſt, two hours before Dinner, and two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Sea-Onion roaſted, and beaten well with a ſufficient quantity of Honey,</hi> and given to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſo much as a Nutmeg at a time, is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93677:70"/>eight ounces; let it juſt boil up again, ſcum it, and keep it for uſe, of which take two or three ſpoonfuls firſt and laſt, and at any other time.</p>
               <p>This Method is not onely proper in the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or difficulty in Breathing, but for the Cough.</p>
               <p>Bleeding is very neceſſary in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, therefore open a Vein in the Fit (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) if the Blood ſeem to abound.

               <p>As touching the Cure,</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if the Body do abound with filthy Humours, or be full of Blood, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with open the Liver-Vein on the ſame ſide, for with ſo doing, Blood is not onely drawn, but the part grieved quickly purged.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THough the <hi>Ptiſick</hi> ſignifies a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yet it may be moſt properly taken for that Leanneſs of Body which follows an Ulcer in the Lungs.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is commonly cauſed through ſharp fretting and gnawing Humours, which falls from the Head upon the Lungs.</p>
               <p>It is alſo cauſed through Blood and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which continue after the breaking out of the ſame in ſuch that have the Pleureſie, and ſometimes the Dropſie and French Diſeaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the very principal Cauſes of the Conſumption.</p>
               <p>The chief Signs of this Diſtemper are known by flowing of flegm from the Head upon the Lungs, which cauſeth a Tickling and ſmall Cough, the Spittle ſomewhat hot and bitter, the whole Body waſteth, and the fleſh becomes exceeding looſe, the Hair falls off, the Noſtrils very thin and ſharp, the Temples fallen down, the Eyes hollow,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93677:73"/>the Balls of the Cheeks ſwarthy or Leaden coloured, the Shoulder-Bones ſtick out, the Patient often vexed with a Hectick or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fever, and breathes with much difficulty, the Nails become pale and crooked, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Belly often tormented with violent pain, and much troubled with thirſt, and if the Lungs are ulcerated, what the Patient ſpits will be of a ſtrong foetid or ſtinking Smell.</p>
               <p>And the Cure often proves very difficult.</p>
               <p>However in the firſt place, let the Patient (if poſſible) be removed into ſome whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome place where the Air is clear and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, neither too hot nor too cold.</p>
               <p>And if you perceive the Lungs to be ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, purge once a week with the following Medicines, eſpecially where the Body is not become very lean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Caſſia newly drawn one ounce, the fine Powder of Liquoriſh two ſcruples,</hi> and make a <hi>Bolus</hi> thereof, which give to the Patient in the morning.</p>
               <p>Or take of the choiceſt <hi>Manna</hi> from one ounce to two ounces, and diſſolve it in Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Broth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and drink it off as afore-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>Or take <hi>Liquoriſh, Raiſins</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93677:74"/>Flowers of <hi>Bugloſs</hi> and <hi>Violets,</hi> of each three drams, <hi>Barly</hi> one ounce and a half, <hi>Jujubes</hi> four in number; being cut and bruiſed, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Water</hi> to three or four ounces, to which add two ounces of the diſtilled water of <hi>Scabios,</hi> wherein have been firſt infuſed <hi>Yellow Sanders</hi> and the beſt <hi>Rubarb,</hi> of each four ſcruples, <hi>Manna</hi> one ounce, Syrup of <hi>Roſes</hi> three drams, (add the two latter laſt) being mixed together, make a potion thereof, which take in the morning.</p>
               <p>But in the beginning of this Diſeaſe you may give ſtronger Purges, nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than my <hi>Cathartique and Diuretique Pills,</hi> for they above all purging Medicines carry off the ſalt and ſharp Catarrh which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of ſuch Ulcers.</p>
               <p>After which make uſe of the following Medicine, with which I have done wonders in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take White-Roſe-water, one ounce, white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Candy ſix drams, the Yolk of one new-laid Egge, new Milk warm from the Cow, or made ſo, a quarter of a pint;</hi> being beaten well together, let the Patient drink it all at once, repeating the ſame morning and evening for ſome time together.</p>
               <p>You may believe me, this very Medicine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93677:74"/>is worth an hundred times the price of the Book, which I freely communicate.</p>
               <p>To young Children you may make uſe of a wholeſom Womans Milk; and being mixed as aforeſaid will ſerve three or four times; but the beſt way is ſtill to make it up freſh, ſo take but the third or fourth part of each.</p>
               <p>Goats Milk is alſo of wonderful uſe, more eſpecially if taken as afore-directed. And be aſſured that Milk is one of the beſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines againſt the Ptiſick or Conſumption.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Another Excellent Remedy againſt the Conſumption.</head>
                  <p>Take all the Blood that will be had forth of a Pig or Swine in his full ſtrength, and ſtir it as it is drawn forth that it may not congeal; to which add the Powder of <hi>Cloves, Cinamon, Mace</hi> and <hi>Ginger,</hi> of each one ounce, <hi>Saffron,</hi> and the Flowers of <hi>Roſemary,</hi> of each two drams; and forthwith diſtil it in a Glaſs with a very gentle fire: The Doſe is from three Spoonfuls to ſix or eight, in ſo much Tent or Sack, three times a day.</p>
                  <p>Or take the Powder called <hi>Pulvis Haley</hi> one ounce, Conſerve of Red Roſes two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Conſerve of Cowſlips one ounce, with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93677:75"/>a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Violets, make them up into an Electuary, and make it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharp by mixing therewith ſome few drops of Oyl of Vitriol or Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>And take thereof firſt and laſt as much as a Walnut, for it is of wonderful profit to ſuch that are Hectick.</p>
                  <p>Or take Flower of Brimſton, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the beſt Frankincenſe, of each one ſcruple, Saffron three grains, put them into an Apple, the Core being cut forth, and roaſt it, after which let the Patient eat it with White Sugar-Candy for ten or twelve dayes together.</p>
                  <p>New ſtrong Ale wherein is boiled Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock-Roots, Liquoriſh and Honey, is of Excellent Uſe, as I have often proved; and the Poor may with much eaſe attain to this Drink.</p>
                  <p>The Herb <hi>Burnet</hi> made into fine Powder, and White Sugar-Candy, of each one dram, taken often in Broth, is alſo very good.</p>
                  <p>Or <hi>take White-Wine</hi> three pints, <hi>Sugar-Candy</hi> four ounces, the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Elicampane</hi> one ounce, <hi>Green Coltsfoot</hi> two ounces, <hi>Violet Flowers</hi> one ounce and a half, the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> ten drams, being cut and bruiſed very ſmall, boil them in a Stone Bottle cloſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,

With this very Medicine after I had gently purged a Painter, I perfectly cured him in few days, though he was by all his friends left for a dead man, he was ſo much conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and did ſtink that none could endure to come near him.</p>

                  <p>Sugar of Roſes drunk in New Milk, made as followeth, is alſo of moſt admirable Uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Red-Roſe-Buds, the whites being cut off, and dried ſuddenly in the Sun, two ounces, Double-Refined-Sugar two pounds,</hi> being melted in the Juice of Roſes and Roſe-Water, of each four ounces.

                  <p>Natural Balſom is of excellent uſe for ſuch that have Ulcers in the Lungs, if you make White-Sugar-Candy up into Pills as big as Gray Peaſe therewith, and take one faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Morning, for ſome Time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p>The hot Diſtemper doth not only burn up the humours which were before in the Liver, but the Humours conveighed thereunto by the Meſentery-Veins.</p>
               <p>The cold Diſtemper doth cauſe the crude and flegmatick humor that already is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Liver, to be groſs and very tough, and exceeding hard to be removed; and the Humours conveighed to the Liver are left many times but half digeſted.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Of the DROPSIE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Dropſie</hi> is a preternatural Collection of a thinniſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are in general three ſorts of Dropſies:</p>
               <p>The firſt is called <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Tympanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third <hi>Anaſarca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſcites</hi> is a ſwelling of the Belly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Legs and Feet, cauſed by a ſerous Humour, and being of the Nature of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is cold, but as it is ſalt it hath in it heat, cauſed by the nearneſs of the Bowels, and the more by the putrifaction which is gathered by long continuance, from whence comes a fever and thirſt, namely from the ſtinking ſalt vapours which do infect the Orifice or mouth of the Stomach.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:93677:86"/>
               <p>The Dropſie called <hi>Tympanites</hi> hath its Name from a Drum, becauſe the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is extended or ſtretched forth like to a Drum; and being ſtruck with your hand it ſounds like it. This extention is from Wind ſhut up in the hollowneſs of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the hollowneſs of the Guts. The wind which cauſeth a Tympany is ſeldom contained in the Belly alone, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mixed with water; as in <hi>Aſcites</hi> not only water, but wind alſo is contained. Both which Dropſies have their Name of that which predominateth; if more wind than water, it is a Tympany; if more water than wind, an <hi>Aſcites;</hi> but if equal, between both; they cannot always be diſcerned one from the other.</p>
               <p>The chief cauſe of wind is a raw Humour and thick, whether Flegm or Melancholy, which being ſtirred and made thin by heat, ſends forth thick vapours, which are called <hi>flatus,</hi> and are hard to be diſſolved. This thick raw Humour is partly in the Stomach and Guts, but more eſpecially between the Membranes of the Midriff and Guts. So the more hard to be removed, than from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the parts aforeſaid; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>They who have pains and gripings about
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93677:86"/>the Navel and Loins which cannot be removed, have a dry Dropſie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Dropſie called <hi>Anaſarca</hi> comes of a flegmatick Humour diſperſed through the whole Body, and therefore the Body is ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and puft up, and ſeems white, from whence the Diſeaſe is called <hi>Leucophlegmatia.</hi> This Flegm comes from a cold Liver, which inſtead of good Blood produceth raw and flegmatick, and when it cannot be turned into the ſubſtance of the parts, leaves the raw part thereof unfit for nouriſhment upon them, and ſo makes them ſwell, from whence comes <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> or <hi>Leucophlegmatia:</hi> this Diſeaſe in the beginning is called <hi>Cachexia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moſt Dropſies are cauſed through great coldneſs of the Liver, or through other parts over-much cooled, which doth bring the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oftentimes into the ſame affect. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is affected by the Spleen being cold, and by the Stomach and Bowels; likewiſe by the Lungs, the Reins, and Diaphragma, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the immoderate flux of the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoids, or through the ſuperfluity of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens monthly Sickneſs, but commonly through the obſtruction or ſtoppage of the ſame: and often through ſome other great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93677:87"/>affection of the Womb. And in all theſe the Liver is found without unnatural ſwelling, and yet the Body affected with the Dropſie, cauſed through the over-coldneſs of the Liver affected in the firſt place; but afterward it groweth hard, which may be ſeen in them which by drinking over-much ſmall Beer and cold water have their Liver cooled, ſo that the Dropſie forthwith followeth, before the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is puft up with knotty ſwelling; ſome fall into this Diſtemper through the loſs of much Blood, others after long-continued Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>☞ But thouſands in theſe days through the exceſſive drinking of Brandy, which beyond all other Liquors commonly drunk, Burns and dries up the Radical Moiſture, hinders the circulation of the Blood, and turns it into a ſerous matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which follows ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death: for I have not yet hardly ſeen an old Brandy-Drinker to receive a perfect Cure.</p>
               <p>Some fall into the Dropſie after the Gout, or through the violent pain of the Huckle-Bones, commonly ſuch whoſe Stomachs are dejected, and have no good Digeſtion, and have an evil habit of Body, and troubled with the Jaundice, forthwith follows the Dropſie.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93677:87"/>Sometimes thoſe who have a <hi>Dyſenteria</hi> and the <hi>French Pox,</hi> the <hi>Dropſie</hi> alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Symptoms or Signs of the Dropſie are in brief as followeth:</head>
                  <p>In that Dropſie called <hi>Aſcites,</hi> the whole Belly is ſwelled up; and if it be but ſtricken, there is heard ſuch a kind of ſound as a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle maketh that is not full of water; but the other parts, eſpecially the upper parts of the Body, are not ſwelled not puffed up.</p>
                  <p>In that Dropſie called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is puffed up, and extended forth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtricken, it maketh a noiſe much like to a Tabor or Trimbrel: but the other parts of the Body becomes lean.</p>
                  <p>In that Dropſie called <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> &amp;c. all the whole Body waxeth looſe, and as it were like to a Spunge, ſo that it ſwelleth up, and is like to a dead Body.</p>
                  <p>In moſt Dropſies, the Feet, Ankles, and Legs, eſpecially upon the Shin-Bones, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſwell firſt; ſometimes the Belly and Privy Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that if you thruſt your fingers thereon, the part will pit, and leave an impreſſion; the colour of the Skin,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93677:88"/>eſpecially the Face, is pale and ſwarthy, the Urine little and thick, and oftentimes very red, the Breath ſhort, the Appetite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or altogether loſt, a troubleſom thirſt, by reaſon of the ſharpneſs and ſaltneſs of the humour in which the Stomach ſwimmeth, (and <hi>if not in time prevented</hi>) then follows a lingering Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the corruption of the water, which at length doth corrupt all the Bowels ſwimming therein.</p>
                  <p>☞ As touching the moſt infallible Cure of Men in Dropſies ever yet found out, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve truely the following Method, and take my word for it you will never have cauſe to repent, neither have need to fool your ſelves with Medicines that are not in the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
                  <p>So in the firſt place know that one Diet may properly be made uſe of in all ſorts of Dropſies, provided it be of light digeſtion, and dry; for that meat that is looſe and moiſt, is apt to turn into water: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make uſe of Partridges, Black-birds, Thruſhes, Larks and Chickens, eſpecially the extream parts; alſo of Rabbets, Hares, Goats and Mutton well roaſted.</p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:93677:88"/>
                  <p>And let the Patient abſtain from Milk, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termilk, Cheeſe and Whey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from all ſorts of Fiſh except Crabs, and from Eggs if not well roaſted; and from all kinds of broths, except ſuch that have <hi>Parſly, Smallage, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niroyal, Garden-Creſſes, Elder-Buds, Leeks, Onions</hi> and <hi>Garlick</hi> boiled therein; and from all manner of Fruits except <hi>ſweet Almonds, Nuts, Pomgranates, dry Figs, Pippins roaſted,</hi> and <hi>Pears baked,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Wardens,</hi> and theſe to be taken moderately.</p>
                  <p>Let the Patient forbear drinking of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and all other hot Spirits, ſophiſticated VVines, ſmall Beer and VVater of all ſorts, for that deſtroys many labouring under the Dropſie, witneſs the VVells.</p>
                  <p>Let your Drink the VVhite-VVine and Rheniſh Wine, or Wormwood-Ale and White-wine mixed together: Beer not too ſtrong, nor too ſmall, but for the moſt part make uſe of the Drink directed hereafter; but be very ſparing in all, and indure thirſt as much as poſſible; in order to it, mix Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and ſteeled VVater together, and waſh your mouth there-with, and often chew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick therein, and eat of Sea-Biskets or hard Cruſts of Bread, for it draws water forth of the Stomach to the Mouth, ſo quencheth thirſt.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93677:89"/>
                  <p>And when you perceive any of the Signs made mention of in page 147, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ <hi>Forthwith make uſe of my Cathartique and Diuretique Pills;</hi> for they are the Only Famous and Safe Medicine (ever yet known in the world, to combat the Dropſie) <hi>whoſe Compoſition is without Mercury or any other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Ingredients,</hi> as many other Medicines are (to the great damage of the Patient) too frequently given in this deplorable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>The Patient newly taken with the Dropſie may take of thoſe Pills every ſecond or third day.</p>
                  <p>But where the Diſeaſe is ſtubborn and of long continuance, begin with two Pills, more or leſs, according to the Age and Strength of the Patient, and take them every day, if ſtrength will permit, and ſo continue for a month or ſix weeks, if need require. And be not perſwaded by any means to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for I never yet knew them fail, where the Diſtemper was really accounted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>You may take them in the Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at night going to bed, or after your firſt Sleep, or take one at night and two in the morning.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:93677:89"/>
                  <p>But in the Winter-ſeaſon take them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways about five or ſix of the Clock in the morning, leſt by riſing in the night you take cold. If you have any Inclination to reſt, you may lie in your Bed two or three hours after the taking thereof, and they will work the better.</p>
                  <p>You may ſwallow them in the Pap of a roaſted Apple, or in the Skin of a Raiſin or Prune, or in a preſerved Cherry, or with Beer or Ale, or any other way.</p>
                  <p>Such that cannot take them whole as they are, may cut them very ſmall, and make them up into an Electuary, or into a <hi>Bolus,</hi> with a ſmall quantity of <hi>Venice-Treacle, Mithridate,</hi> or <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> or with any Cordial Syrup, eſpecially if the Stomach be cold.</p>
                  <p>Such whoſe Bodies abound with heat, and notwithſtanding the Dropſie are Hectick, may take them with a ſmall quantity of the Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Electuary, <hi>Caſsia</hi> newly drawn, or with Syrup of Roſes or Violets. And if the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be very hot, they will operate the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You need not drink Poſſet or Broth, as with other Phyſick, but if dry what you pleaſe, as VVhite-wine, Beer, or Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> warm; but, as afore-directed, be moderate.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:93677:90"/>
                  <p>☞ Such that take my Pills againſt that Dropſie called <hi>Aſcites,</hi> who through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Body, by reaſon of long Sickneſs, cannot make uſe thereof ſo often as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, the Belly being ſubject to Coſtiveneſs, let them ſometimes make uſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gliſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the Flowers of Camomile and wild Laurel, of each two drams, Agarick and Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody of the Oak, of each one dram and a half, Doder half an ounce;</hi> being bruiſed, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of VVater or VVhite-wine to the conſumption of the third part; then ſtrain it, and add to one pint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Honey of Roſes one ounce and a half, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries of Nidum, and Benedicta Laxitiva, of each three drams, Oyl of Camomile, Rue and Orris, of each one ounce;</hi> being mixed together, make a Gliſter thereof.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>CORB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TI,</hi> as Authors ſay, is a barbarous word, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly unknown to moſt of the Ancient Phyſicians, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of the Southern Parts) and derived from the <hi>Danes:</hi> Which Diſeaſe was ſuppoſed to be that which <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh mention of in his Natural Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Principal Cauſes of the Scurvy comes from a thick and ſaltiſh Conſtitution of the Air, being corrupt, as the Air near the Sea, fenny, foggy, or moiſt places, which infect by the unwholeſome Vapours coming from the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:93677:94"/>
               <p>Alſo the eating of ſalt Meat, and Bread twice baked, Fiſh over-much dried in the Smoak, ruſty Bacon, and many other ſorts of Diet which are of corrupt nouriſhment: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Beer and ſtinking Water do cauſe this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it comes through the Obſtruction of the Spleen; the courſe of Melancholy being hindred, and mixed with the reſt of the Blood, infecteth the whole Body with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and violent waſting: The groſſer part falling down, ſtaineth the Legs with ſpots of divers colours; the thinner part being carried up, doth defile the Gums with ſharp, ſalt, and fretting humours, and filthy growing of fleſh between the Teeth.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Symptoms or Signs of the Scurvy are in chief as followeth:</head>
                  <p>A pricking and grievous pain in the Head, a ſtinking Breath or evil ſavour of the Mouth, Jaws and Teeth, the Gums bleed, and are often red, and itch, and ſoon corrupt, the Teeth looſe, black, and rotten.</p>
                  <p>Spots in the Face, Body, Thighs and Legs, at firſt commonly Red, but afterwards Blew, Purple-colour, or Black, ſometimes Yellow,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93677:94"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which proceeds from the ſerous, corrupt and filthy part of the Blood, which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to nouriſh the Body, is ſent forth.</p>
                  <p>The Patient is often troubled with a ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and as it were choked up; the Heart panteth, the Stomach is puffed up, the Left Side is commonly ſwelled; there are percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved frequent Sighings, Belchings, Cramps, and Windineſs, motions to Vomit; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Patient is feveriſh, at other times tremble and ſhiver with cold, and upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hot again; ſometimes heavy, dull, and melancholy, diſability to walk; upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their Breath fail, and it is with very much difficulty, if they uſe but the leaſt motion; when they offer to riſe, or ſit but upright, they are almoſt ready to die, their Spirits ſo much fail them; but when they lie down, they ſeem to be much refreſhed, and breathe not with ſo much difficulty; and for the moſt part their Appetites are ſharp, and greedy of Meat, and deſire to eat often; the Stomach ſeldom failing; but the Belly often coſtive or bound; and yet I have known many ſubject to a continual Flux.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes the Spots in the Legs are broad, and are very black, leaden-colour or blew, and they often ſwell; and ſometimes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93677:95"/>the Legs become ſo much ulcerated, that the Shin-bones lie bare: which Diſeaſe, if not timely prevented, in ſome Conſtitutions will turn into a kind of Leproſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Diſeaſe there are alſo pains in the Shoulders, Arms, Back, Sides, Hips, Thighs, and Legs, eſpecially upon the Shin-bones, which are much like thoſe of the Pox, and may perhaps deceive the Phyſician, <hi>where the Scurvy is Rare, and the Pox common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they may with eaſe be diſtinguiſhed: For the pains of the Pox are between the Joints; and if they continue long, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>Nodes</hi> or <hi>Knots;</hi> and there are or have been other ſigns, as the Running of the Reins, Ulcers in the Privy Parts, ſometimes in the Throat, Pallat, Mouth and Noſtrils; Buboes in the Groin, all which come moſt commonly from Unclean Women.</p>
                  <p>But the pains in the Scurvy ſeiz upon all parts indifferently, and there are many other Symptoms of it, as aforeſaid, at leaſt a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Conſtitution: and the matter is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, if the Patient will in truth affirm that he hath not had <hi>Carnal Copulation with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93677:95"/>
                  <p>There are many other Symptoms of the Scurvy, which for Brevity-ſake I ſhall here omit. And ſo <hi>Demonſtrate a Certain, Safe, and Alſolute Way of Cure,</hi> which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
                  <p>If the Body be Plethorick or full, Let Blood if ſtrength will permit, but in ſmall quantity, and that chiefly in the Hemorrhoid-Veins, by Leeches; but if you perceive the Spleen affected in particular, then open the Middle-Vein in the Left Arm; but if the Liver be more affected, open the Liver-Vein in the right Arm, or the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> or Middle-Vein.</p>
                  <p>But be ſure not to attempt Phlebotomy, if it be not in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. For when the Diſtemper is deep rooted, and hath ſpread it ſelf over the whole Body, <hi>Bleeding</hi> may then prove deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>So begin with the Medicine following, which doubtleſs will prove to be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the Bark of Aſh Tree, the Bark of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of each two drams, Pollipody two drams and a half, the Roots of Black Hellebore, firſt boiled in the diſtilled Water of Balm, and dried, three drams, Fennel-ſeeds, Annis-ſeeds, of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93677:96"/>each half a dram, the Roots of China two drams, of the Four Great Cold Seeds, of each one dram, the Leaves of Wormwood, Betony, and the leſſer Centaury, Germander, Cetarach, of each half a handful, Thyme, Epithimum, of each one Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, the Leaves of Senna, and the beſt Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, of each two drams, Conſerve of Burrage, Balm, and Fumatory, of each one ounce;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut and bruiſed, boil them in three pints of Water to the conſumption of the third part, ſtrain it, and let the Patient drink a quarter of a pint two hours before Supper, repeating the ſame as need require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take of the beſt Senna two drams, the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Rhubarb one dram;</hi> being bruiſed, infuſe them in <hi>five or ſix ounces of the Diſtilled Water of Wormwood,</hi> for the ſpace of one night; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſtrain it, and add thereto <hi>Diacatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon two drams, the Electuary of Roſes one dram, Syrup of Epithimum half an ounce;</hi> mix them together, and take it warm in the morning, faſting after it ſix hours.</p>
                  <p>☞ But the moſt infallibleſt way that I can in truth direct you to for the Cure of this now Common Diſeaſe, is to make uſe of my <hi>Cathartique and Diuretique Pills,</hi> for they ſo highly Purifie and Sweeten the <hi>Blood,</hi> that no other Medicine can be compared to them in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93677:96"/>the Cure of the Dropſie and Scurvy, with all other ſharp, ſalt and watry Humours.</p>
                  <p>And with them make uſe of the Diet-Drink directed firſt in the Chapter of the Dropſie, page 156.</p>
                  <p>Or ſometimes make uſe of the following Medicines:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take Brook-lime, Water-Creſſes, the leſſer Celandine, Wormwood, and Fumatory, of each one handful, Red-Dock-Roots one pound, Horſe-Radiſh four ounces;</hi> being cut and bruiſed, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of ſmall Ale, with a quart or more of VVhite-wine, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the third part; being ſtrained, keep it for uſe: of which let the Patient take a quarter of a pint firſt and laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take Hyſop, Germander, Betony, Ceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach, Carduus, Aſarum, Agrimony, Burrage, and Bugloſs, of each one handful, the Flowers of Tamarisk, and Doder of Time, of each one ounce, the Bark of Cappers, Tamarisk, and Aſh, of each two ounces, Pollipody of the Oak, and Red-Dock-Roots, of each two ounces and a half;</hi> being cut and bruiſed, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of ſmall Ale mixed with VVhite-wine, to the Conſumption of the third part, and drink thereof, as afore-dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take the Juice of both ſorts of Scurvy-graſs, White-wine and the Juice of Oranges, of each one pint;</hi> being mixed together, drink thereof firſt and laſt three or four ſpoonfuls at a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take the Juice of Lemons, Sorrel, Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Water-Creſſes, Fumatory and White-Wine, of each an equal quantity;</hi> being mixed together, take thereof as afore-directed.</p>
                  <p>Always obſerve to drink it warm, ſo you may take thereof, notwithſtanding the taking my <hi>Pills,</hi> which with them will prove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly effectual in this Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>After you have purged ſufficiently with my Pill, if much broke out, make uſe of the following Ointment:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such that have the Scurvy in the Gums, notwithſtanding taking of my Pills, let them take <hi>Vinegar of Squills, and Plantane Water,</hi> and gargle therewith.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Stone in the Kidneys</hi> is cauſed through a perpetual crudity or rawneſs of the Stomach, whereby abundance of tough, groſs and earthy Humours are heaped together; and being of a fiery heat about the Reins, parcheth the Humours, and baketh them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a Stone.</p>
               <p>They differ much both in figure, colour, and ſharpneſs, for they are often found to be black, ſometimes pale, or of a whitiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>The Sign of this Diſeaſe is violent pain in the Reins, inſomuch that the Patient can hardly turn his Back-bone; there is alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of Meat, and motion to Vomit, the Urine is made but in very little quantity, and many times wholly ſtopped; ſometimes there is voided Blood; the bottom of the Urine gravelly, which ſhews ſome motion of the Stone from the Reins. The Stones that are light, ſmooth, and round, paſs forth with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93677:101"/>ſome eaſe; but thoſe that are long, ſharp, and jagged, are ſent forth with violent pain.</p>
               <p>To help this moſt violent Diſtemper, if the Body be full of Excrements, make uſe of the following Gliſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Pellitory of the Wall, Maiden-hair, Mercury, Mallows, and Marſh-Mallows, of each one good handful, Water-Creſſes, one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and a half, Smallage, Fennel, Parſly and Linſeed, of each two or three drams, Bran and the Roots of Flower-de-luce, of each one ounce;</hi> being cut and bruiſed, boil them in a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of water, to the conſumption of the third part; then ſtrain it, and take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one pint: to which add <hi>Honey of Roſes, and Caſſia newly drawn, of each one ounce, Hiera Picra half an ounce, Oyl of Rue, Camomile, and Dill, of each one ounce, Sal Prunella one dram and a half;</hi> mix them together, and make a Gliſter thereof, which miniſter to the Patient as need require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or take Mercury, Mallows, Marſh-Mallow-Roots, Camomile, of each one handful;</hi> being cut and bruiſed, boil them in one quart of new Milk, to the conſumption of half; after which, turn the Milk with Ale; then ſtrain it, and take one pint of the ſtrained Liquor, to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93677:102"/>which add the <hi>Lenitive Electuary and Diaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon, of each ſix drams, Venice-Turpentine half an ounce, Syrup of Marſh-Mallows one ounce and a half, Oyl of Lillies, Dill, Rue and Camomile, of each half an ounce, Chymical Oil of Juniper twenty drops;</hi> being mixed well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, give it Gliſter-ways; for it giveth eaſe, and cauſeth the Patient to void ſmall ſtones, as I have often ſeen.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of the Gliſter, if the Belly be not coſtive, adminiſter to the Patient the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Potion, for it is of Excellent uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the Lenitive Electuary one ounce, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Marſh-Mallows two ounces, Cream of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Holland Powder, of each one ſcruple, Salt of Tartar ten grains, with four ounces of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Water of Oaken Leaves;</hi> make a potion thereof, which let the Patient take all at once in the morning warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or you may take of Caſſia newly drawn, and Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of each half an ounce, Diaphaenicon two drams, Powder of Rhubarb fifteen or twenty grains, Liquorice in Powder half a dram, Syrup of Violets one ounce;</hi> with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of the Diſtilled Water of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows make a potion thereof, which take as afore-directed.</p>

               <p>In every drought take ten drops, or more, of the Spirit of Vitriol, and it will prove the more effectual.</p>
               <p>Or you may take the Diſtilled Water of Pellitory and Saxifrage, of each alike, and ſweeten it with Syrup of Violets and Marſh-Mallows, adding thereto Spirit of Vitriol, and take it as afore-directed.</p>
               <p>The meaner ſort of People may boil a good quantity of Saxifrage, Couch-graſs, and Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Wall, in running Water, and ſweeten it with Honey, and drink thereof: for it is very effectual, for it mollifieth the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93677:103"/>paſſages, and cauſeth the Stone to come away the more freely.</p>
               <p>Holly-Berries bruiſed and boiled in Wine or Ale, doth the ſame to admiration.</p>
               <p>Or being dried and beat to power, and a dram thereof drunk in White-wine, is alſo very good; but ſuch that cannot get VVhite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, muſt be content with Ale.</p>
               <p>Or take Pigeons-Dung, and fill a large Glaſs therewith half full; after which fill it up with the beſt VVhite-VVine, then cover it very cloſe, and let it ſtand for ſeven days; after which, diſtill in Sand. Of which let the Patient drink two ounces at a time, repeating the ſame as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: for it is a very Excellent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Break and Bring away the Stone and Gravel.</p>
               <p>Or take Goats Blood prepared, one dram, VVhite Amber one ſcruple, VVhite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, and the Juice of Radiſhes, of each two ounces; being mixed together, drink it off, often repeating the ſame.</p>

               <p>The Signs are violent ſharp and pricking pains in the Bladder for the moſt part; the Patient with his Urine voideth dregs &amp; ſlimy matter, and in the bottom appears a ſediment like to Bran, or ſmall Pieces of thin Skin; and if the Ulcers are deep, the Urine is bloody, and full of ſtinking Pus or matter; and then the more difficult to be cured.</p>
               <p>But if they are not deep, nor of too long ſtanding, the pains may be eaſed and the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers cured by the Medicines made as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. <hi>Of the Gonorrhea, or Running of the Reins.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF this Diſtemper there are three ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, VVhen the Sperm or Seed is ſhed againſt the Patients conſent, and for the moſt part is cauſed through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Retentive Virtue in the Veſſels containing the ſame, and ſometimes through a Flux of the Spermatick Veſſels, which is many times watery, and very thin, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Appetite to Carnal Copulation; yet ſometimes it doth come forth with a kind of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a Nocturnal Polution through Dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which men are moſt ſubject to, whoſe Liver, Reins, and Seminary Veſſels do abound with heat.</p>
               <p>The third is a virulent Gonorrhea, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes a Symptom that doth follow the French Diſeaſe. VVhich Diſtemper is known by an iſſue from the ſecret parts, not of Sperm,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93677:111"/>but of corrupt and poyſonous matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, which excoriates and ulcerates the Urinary paſſages, from whence follows a very ſharp and ſcalding heat and violent pain in making water, the Patient not able to endure the erection of the Yard; between the Glans and Prepuce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often grows ſeveral pieces of Fleſh much reſembling Warts or Strawberries; all being of evil conſequence, if not timely prevented, or perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>In order to which, in the firſt place make uſe of the cooling <hi>Bolus</hi> made as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Take of the beſt Rhubarb one ſcruple, <hi>Sal Prunella, Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> and <hi>Tartarum Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolatum,</hi> of each ten grains, <hi>Caſsia</hi> newly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or the Lenitive Electuary, from ſix to eight drams; being mixed well together, let the Patient take one part at night going to bed, and the reſt in the morning faſting. Thus do every day, or every ſecond, for ten days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Or take Extract of <hi>Rudii</hi> two drams, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Dulcis</hi> well prepared two ſcruples, with a ſufficient quantity of the Juice of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, make them up into twenty Pills, which take two at night and three in the morning.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93677:112"/>
               <p>Or take Roſin of Jallap and Scamony pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Sulphur, of each two drams, <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> one dram; make them up into <hi>Pills</hi> with <hi>Venice</hi>-Turpentine waſhed in Plantane-VVater, and let the Patient take thereof from one ſcruple to half a dram eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, if ſtrength permit.</p>
               <p>Or take Roſin of Scamony, Jallap, Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and Salt of Tartar, of each two drams, <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> one dram, make them up into a maſs for Pills with Turpentine, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed; and take thereof from one ſcruple to half a dram, or two ſcruples.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Medicines that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of crude <hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. which I know to be of excellent uſe, if adminiſtred with diſcretion.</p>

               <p>In the uſe of either of the Medicines above directed, the more to eaſe the pains, and to abate the violent ſharpneſs and heat of Urine, make uſe of the following Liquor.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:93677:112"/>

               </p>
               <p>Some years paſt, there was but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it among us, but now it is become frequent, and daily bringeth with it many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and deteſtable Evils, and very ſad and troubleſome accidents, which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is but ſmall, yet in proceſs of time (the Patient wanting an honeſt and able Phyſician) groweth to ſuch a height, that it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt the Humours and Spirits, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly offend the <hi>Nerves, Membranes, Tendons, Fleſh and Bones,</hi> and at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all other parts of the Body, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temperature and whole ſubſtance thereof; from whence proceedeth divers ſorts of Excrements.</p>

               <p>This moſt ſinful and curſed Diſeaſe is very occult, and doth lie hid in the Body many months before it is perfectly diſcovered.</p>
               <p>And the principal Part affected is the Liver, as may appear by the natural Actions: for in the Stomach there is an evil Concoction, from whence ariſeth a vaſt alteration of Colour, a great indiſpoſition of Body, the Appetite to the ſports of <hi>Venus</hi> as it were altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or loſt; it hath relation to the whole ſubſtance of the Liver, rather than to the Heart or Brain; and it doth aſſault the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpirits (rather than the vital and animal) which being corrupt, muſt needs infect the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; from whence followeth ſhedding of hair, itching about the privy parts, filthy ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ulcers and virulent Gonorrhea's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>The Cauſe of this moſt ſilthy Diſeaſe</head>
                  <p>Is a ſordid and malignant quality containing in it ſelf a very profound Contagion, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from one perſon infected to another, by Carnal Copulation with foul Women (as afore-mentioned) and the parts ſerving for Generation are for the moſt part infected firſt, by reaſon of their tender and pure ſubſtance,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93677:115"/>and in the like manner this malignant quality is communicated to the Mouth and Throat, and to the Skin: and the more weak the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties and Virtues of the Liver are, the ſooner doth it infect; from whence it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls out, that many uſing one filthy VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are as it were all infected; but ſuch men who have their natural Faculties vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or ſtrong, are not ſo ſoon infected.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93677:115"/>filthy Ulcers, not only in the Throat, but in the Mouth, Tongue, Jaws and Noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Commonly the Hair of the Head and Beard falls off, and there doth frequently appear in the Forehead, and other parts of the Head, Joynts, and upon the Shin-Bones, Nodes, Knots, or hard Tumours, not eaſily to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved nor cured, which doth in time corrupt the very Bones and Marrow contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Patient takes little reſt becauſe the pains are more violent in the night than in the day.</p>

                     <hi>Take Caſsia newly extracted, Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, of each half an ounce, the Electuary of the Juice of Roſes two drams, Mercurius Dulcis ten grains; with a ſufficient quantity of the Diſtilled Water of Fumatory, make a Potion thereof, which take in the morning faſting.</hi>

                  <p>After which, open the Liver Vein in the Right Arm, the Patient not having Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes in the Groin; if ſo, Bleeding will do much harm, in drawing back the Contagion to the Liver, cauſing the Diſeaſe to be more dangerous and painful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Whether Bleeding may be ſafely attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not, the matter is not great. However let the Patient be purged ſufficiently with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fore-mentioned Electuaries.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. <hi>Of the GOUT.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is frequently ingendred through perpetual Crudities and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and through the immoderate uſe of Venery, by vehement riding and walking, and ſometimes by ſtanding long ſtill; alſo through obſtruction or ſtopping of accuſtomed Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Fluxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and through intermitting of common Exerciſe. Grief, or Sorrow, Care, VVatchings, or ſitting up all night, and ſeveral other Perturbations of the Mind, doth not only breed this miſerable Diſtemper, but doth ingender other violent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humours. And many times the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is turned into the Gout, being not well cured.</p>
               <p>But for the moſt part a diſpoſition to this Diſtemper is hereditary, or from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the Children, and to their Poſterity; and in eſpecial manner from ſuch Parents that have been tainted with the Pox, whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, at leaſt, muſt be troubled with the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93677:125"/>Gout, being (in my opinion) ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the Gout are many, which here I muſt omit; but only when it is near at hand the Patient hath a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe and quickneſs in his Joints, in ſo much that the ſmalleſt matter will hurt him. And at the very beginning of it there will be found in the Joints a ſenſe as it were like to crawling Piſmires, with a kind of unuſual heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is known to be preſent by a violent pain in the Joints, which for the moſt part is attended with ſwelling and redneſs; if not at firſt, it appears preſently after, and the pain commonly ſeizes upon the great Toe upon the left Foot, and often times it ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to the other Joints.</p>
               <p>The Gout that is Hereditary, or very long contracted, the Patient having hard and ſtony knots about the Joints, and more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſubject to be coſtive and bound, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that have the Gout, and not over-much ſtricken in years, and are inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exerciſes, and are without the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſtony knots, may be cured.</p>
               <div type="section">

                  <head>☞ In order to which Cure,</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Patient make uſe of my Cathartique and Diuretique Pills,</hi> and of the ſweating <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> made as followeth.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take Venice-Treacle one dram and a half, Diaphoretick Antimony ten grains, Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar ſeven grains;</hi> mix them together, and take it as afore-directed, and ſweat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or take the Roots of Aſarum four ounces, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus and Centaury, of each two good handfuls, the Roots of Groundpine two ounces;</hi> boil theſe in ſix quarts of Running VVater to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of half, ſtrain it, and let the Patient take half a pint at a time hot, and ſweat as above-directed, for ſome days together.</p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:93677:126"/>
                  <p>☞ But firſt let the Body be ſufficiently purged with my Pills; and once or twice a week, upon a day that you ſweat not, purge therewith alſo, for they will not only keep the Body ſoluble, but expel all acrimonious ſharp and fretting humours from the Joynts; by which means, with the uſe of the ſweating Medicines, the Gout I have often known cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>And after you have purged and ſweat, ſo that you have found Eaſe or Cure thereby, make uſe of the following Pills, for they much ſtrengthen the parts made weak, and prevents the return of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take Venice-Turpentine made into Powder, two ounces, Turmarick, and the Roots of Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, of each one dram and a half, the Powder of Aſh-Keys one dram, the Salt of Aſh and Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, of each twenty grains, Salt and Spirit of Wormwood, of each ten grains;</hi> with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Syrup of Groundpine make them up into Pills as big as VVhite Peas, and take thereof five at a time every morning faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout <hi>March</hi> in the Year 1661. many Perſons ſorely torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me for Advice, and then being ignorant of any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine (though I had made trial of many) that would combat the ſame, put me upon a ſevere Study; and ſoon after, by ſearching the Great Volume of Nature, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Property and occult Quality of <hi>Metals, Minerals,</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> I arrived
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93677:130"/>to the Knowledge and true Preparation of this moſt <hi>Incomparable Medicine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the firſt Pill that ever I gave thereof, was to a very worthy Perſon, <hi>a Good Friend of mine,</hi> at which inſtant of time I took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſelf, which wrought upon us both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange effects, expelling not onely viſcous or tough flegmatick Humours, that lay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Tunicles of the Stomach, but all ſharp ſalt and watry Humours that were found of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.</p>
               <p>And I will aſſure thee, Reader, that this Gentleman and many others, with my ſelf, ever ſince the year 1662. upon the leaſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Body, have made uſe of thoſe Pills, and thereby preſerved our Bodies in Priſtine Health.</p>
               <p>Which may be a ſufficient Argument to convince the People that this is a very Safe Medicine, leaving no evil Qualities behind it, as ſome of the ſame Faculty (falſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Patient) do report.</p>
               <p>In the year 1663. I effected many ſtrange Cures upon perſons very dangerouſly afflicted with the Dropſie and Scurvy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt which, Captain <hi>Matthew Hall,</hi> now belonging to Her Majeſties Life-Guard, being much troubled with the Dropſie and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93677:131"/>Scurvy; for which he drunk plentifully of <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-Waters, being there to wait upon Her Majeſty; but finding it rather deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, than to do him the leaſt good againſt the Dropſie, he forthwith made uſe of my Pills, by which he had preſent help, and will upon requeſt teſtifie the ſame.</p>
               <p>About <hi>September</hi> the ſame year, I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a Gentleman then living in <hi>Black Friars,</hi> ſorely tormented with the Dropſie, and from ſome other cauſe had Buboes in his Groins, which were newly broke, putting him to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great miſery; which with the Dropſie, were ſoon cured with my Pills: Onely he kept the Sores clean with White-wine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was diſſolved a ſmall quantity of <hi>Egyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and applied thereto the Plaiſter of white Lead.</p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>John Powel</hi> a Taylor, living then near to the aforeſaid place, troubled with a Tertian Ague, his Legs much ſwelled, who had a great Pain in his Back, was in a very ſhort time cured with my Pills.</p>
               <p>The following Winter I was called to a Gentlewoman then living in <hi>Newgate</hi>-Market, who had been for ſome years troubled with a violent pain in her Stomach, and had made trial of many Medicines for help, but found
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93677:131"/>none, till ſhe made uſe of my Pills; and drinking with them the Decoction of Pellito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Spain</hi> and Gallingal, as you have dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted pag. 127. was perfectly cured, and in a ſhort time conceived with Child, though ſhe had had none before, though married ſeven years.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>September</hi> 1664. Mr. <hi>Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> then living in <hi>Field-Lane</hi> near <hi>Holburn,</hi> ſorely afflicted with the Dropſie, Scurvy, and Gout, was in three weeks time perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with my Pills, and Sweating <hi>Bolus,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Chapter of the Gout, pag. 225. who lived till the year 1669. though well ſtricken in years, and at laſt ſuppoſed to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his days by drinking of Brandy.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Eaſter</hi>-week 1665. I was called to a perſon of Quality, who had been married five or ſix years at leaſt, which by reaſon of the over-much moiſtneſs and ſlipperineſs of the Womb, could not conceive with Child, and by taking four and twenty of my Pills, with the uſe of a Cordial Liquor I directed her to take upon the intermitting days, ſhe conceived before <hi>Whitſunday</hi> next following, and ſhe was brought to Bed of a Girl about <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> which is very well known to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality living now in this Honourable
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93677:132"/>City, who will be ready to declare the truth hereof, if demanded. Many other Great Cures I could inform you of, but muſt here omit.</p>
               <p>About <hi>April</hi> 1666. my Occaſions called me to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Phyſicians there leaving the City, I was by the deſire of <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby</hi> Eſquire, then Mayor of the City, ſhut up at the Mermaid-Tavern upon the Back, and after that, at Mr. <hi>Richard Winſtone</hi>'s houſe in the County of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> near the City afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in which infected Houſes I continued the ſpace of three months, and cured all of the Peſt that took my Directions. And after I had my Liberty, the firſt news I heard was of the unhappy Fire in <hi>London,</hi> which was the abſolute Cauſe of my Settlement in that Honourable City, where it is ſtill known that I had a ſufficient practice upon the worſt of Diſeaſes, attended with a wonderful and good ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Patient of the <hi>Dropſie</hi> in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was Mr. <hi>James Perry,</hi> who lived then at the <hi>White Lion</hi> in <hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> who was moſt horribly afflicted with that pernicious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: His Belly, Thighs, and Legs extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwelled, and very hard; inſomuch that he could not go: He had a great Cough and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93677:132"/>Suffocation of the Lungs, loathed his Meat, who for the ſpace of ſeventeen Weeks uſed all means imaginable, and had the Advice of Fifteen Phyſicians; ſome cauſed him to be Cupt, others uſed Scarification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but took no effect; ſo they all left him for a dead man: Yet by Gods Bleſſing with my Pills, which cauſed him to evacuate by Stool at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times about ſixteen Gallons of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Water; beſides, forced Urine freely, all his Swellings forthwith abated, his Ulcers (unskilfully procured) healed, and he was perfectly cured in thirty ſix days.</p>
               <p>About <hi>February</hi> 1666. I was called to one <hi>Richard Buſh</hi> near St. <hi>Nicholas Gate,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably afflicted with the <hi>Yellow Jaundice, Dropſie,</hi> and <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and left by all void of help, was through Gods mercy, and the uſe of my Pills, in a very ſhort time perfectly cured, though he was near ſeventy years of age: and lived two or three years after.</p>
               <p>About which time I cured one Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> who lived then in <hi>Broad-Mead,</hi> that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far gone in the Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>About <hi>Eaſter</hi> 1666. I was called to one Mr. <hi>Robert Lancaſter</hi> then living at the Bell in St. <hi>Nicholas-ſtreet,</hi> who was afflicted very much with a Dropſie, being much ſwelled in his Belly and Legs, alſo hectique; under Cure for ſix months, but to no purpoſe, who had been at great expence in Doctors Fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom I cured under thirty days, with about 20 s. worth of my Pills.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Liſſon</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> far gone in the Dropſie, and had a Cough that ſorely vexed him, was Cured with one 12 <hi>s.</hi> Box of my Pills.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Whitſunday</hi> 1667. I was called to Mr. <hi>William Kinton</hi> Copper-Smith, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living at the <hi>Red Lion</hi> in <hi>Caſtle-ſtreet,</hi> who was troubled with the Dropſie, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſwelled, eſpecially in his Belly, and had a great Cough; was at laſt Cured by two 8 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes of my Pills.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> 1667. I was called to one Mr. <hi>Richard Davies,</hi> belonging then to the Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in <hi>Temple-ſtreet,</hi> very far gone in the Dropſie; his Belly and Members much ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which I cured in a ſhort time.

               <p>And for the future, to prevent ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I counſel the female Sex about the time that thoſe are leaving them, to take ſome of my Pills, (as directed in this Book) for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it hath been found, and ſtill will be, the beſt Medicine under the Heavens in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not only to prevent the Dropſie, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diſtempers that beget Mortality before the appointed time; which none ſhall paſs, neither can Phyſick then take the leaſt effect.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Brenam,</hi> then living at the <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> in <hi>Duffins Alley,</hi> near the Mitre Tavern in <hi>Kings-ſtreet Weſtminſter,</hi> being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far gone in the Dropſie, his Belly, Thighs and Legs very much ſwelled, his appetite as it were altogether dejected or loſt; by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of my Pills, had help in a ſhort time: But about ten or twelve months after, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſon of taking cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fell into a relapſe, and then became ſo extraordinary ſwelled and ſuffocated in his Lungs, that he could hardly breathe; ſo accidentally ſeeing him, proffered
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93677:139"/>to ſerve him; and that I did not doubt, but from a ſecond uſe of my Pills would reſult a ſecond Cure: But by his Diſcourſe I found he had an inclination to try ſome other means; which he did accordingly, and finding all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of that kind ineffectual, himſelf and friends then concluded it a matter impoſſible ever to recover him; then were my Pills their <hi>ultimum refugium;</hi> with two or three Boxes whereof, he was again reſtored to his health, to the admiration of many, that will teſtifie this to be a truth. Since which time, for want of a due regard to his own health, he fell into a Conſumption, and lately expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>A young Lady having the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and being recovered of the ſame; in few months after, by reaſon of ſome Obſtructions, had four Ulcers broke in her left Leg, and could not by any means be healed, until ſhe took my Pills, though it had coſt her before thirty odd pounds, and had drunk plentifully of the Waters too; which by taking three or four Boxes, and keeping the Sores clean with a Liquor I preſcribed, was in thirty days per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured. Therefore I counſel ſuch, that often drink the Waters, not to be without ſome ſmall quantity of my Pills, and take
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93677:140"/>thereof once or twice in a week, though in the aforeſaid courſe; for I well know that thoſe waters are deſtructive to many; more eſpecially to Hydropical Perſons, and ſuch of them that have been great drinkers of Sack and Claret, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For certainly nothing can be more pernicious to them, then to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake raſhly their wonted cuſtom, and fall to drinking of crude or raw Water, which over much cools the Blood <hi>(the very Balſam of life) when by taking of my Pills it will be made ſweet, and ſoon brought to its firſt purity, by which means the Dropſie, with many other violent Diſeaſes, are cured.</hi>

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:93677:141"/>which perfectly cured her in two months; which wonderful Cure was effected in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1670.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Iſaac Key</hi> of <hi>Neyland</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> aged Sixty Nine, ſorely afflicted three or four years with a violent Ague and Fever, firſt ſhaking him for an hour or two, and then followed an extream burning, which continued each Fit 24 hours, and at length he fell into the Dropſie, and was very much ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and troubled with ſharp humours, which broke out, and put him to much pain; he made uſe of all means he could hear of, but found nothing that took the leaſt effect: So hearing of my Pills, and the great Cures ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thereby in the ſame County, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made uſe thereof, which brought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water from him, and alſo abated his Fits in ſo great a meaſure, he ſcarce knew when they came, which before he took of my <hi>Pills,</hi> wholly deprived him of his ſtrength, ſo that he was not able to turn himſelf in his Bed; but in this courſe he loſt no ſtrength, and in a ſhort time thoſe intollerable fits quite left him, and his Dropſie alſo perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>A notable Cure effected upon Mris. <hi>Key</hi> with nine of my Pills; her Diſtemper at firſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93677:142"/>was ſuppoſed to be a Pleuriſie; for which ſhe had been let Blood ſufficiently (though anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) but found no benefit thereby; ſhe was ſo exceeding weak, that the Phyſicians and all her Relations gave her over for a dead VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Her complaint was of Burnt Choler in her Stomach; and ſaid to her Husband, If it could not be removed, ſhe muſt forthwith die: ſo he gave her three of my Pills, which for the preſent cauſed her to be very ſick; but when ſhe had had two or three Stools, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the aforeſaid Choler to be carried off, and wholly to be expelled; after which ſhe perceived more than ordinary hollowneſs in the part before-mentioned; ſo ſhe took three Pills more, which cauſed a good Appetite to eat; and in few days after took the other three, and ſo became perfectly well, to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that ſaw her.</p>
                  <p>A Kinſwoman of <hi>Mris. Keys,</hi> aged about Eighteen, was intollerably afflicted with the Dropſie, and had made uſe of all means ſhe could hear of, but to no purpoſe; and at the laſt by taking of my Pills, was ſtrangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Firſt ſhe took two, and then three, which cauſed her to vomit; afterwards ſhe took four, and then five, which operated ſomewhat ſtronger, and ſo broke a congealed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93677:142"/>ſubſtance that lay in her Body, much in form like to a Cake, which in pieces came forth by Stool, and ſo ſhe became perfectly well, and free from the Dropſie. Not many weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reaſon of a Surfeit, ſhe broke out all over her Face, Body, Thighs, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was ſo lame ſhe could not go; ſhe had alſo a riſing in her Throat, which every hour was like to choak her, and a violent Fever every night, inſomuch that all her Relations and Friends gave her over for dead. But through Gods bleſſing, by taking ſome more of my Pills, was again perfectly cured in the latter end of the year 1670. of all thoſe pernicious infirmities, and now as well or better than ever in health.</p>
                  <p>About the latter end of <hi>April</hi> 1671.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93677:143"/>all means poſſible, and was purged ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>But not with Medicines of the Nature of my Pills, (for I challenge the whole World to produce the like) which are not only</hi> Cathartique <hi>or</hi> Purging, <hi>but withal fortifies or ſtrengthens the Principal Bowels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that is one Reaſon they ſo perfectly cure the Dropſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ A Perſons Daughter of Quality about eight years of Age, never having the perfect uſe of her Limbs; by taking twenty five 4 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes of my Pills, in the ſpace of two years received perfect help thereby, and remaineth to this day free from the leaſt Symptoms of Ach or Pain, and groweth fat and very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; who before the making uſe thereof was ſuppoſed never to have perfect help.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93677:145"/>my fortune to light upon one of your Books; and after my ſelf and Son had peruſed it, my Son had a very great deſire that I ſhould buy one of your</hi> 4 s. <hi>Boxes of</hi> Pills, <hi>and prepare him the Diet-Drink according to your Directions: So every thing being made ready, he began to take the Pills, and in twice or thrice taking, he found a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which made my Self and Wife much to rejoyce: For none that ſaw him in his weakneſs did think he could have lived, but all concluded he was a dead man. He followed taking the Pills, until he had almoſt taken the firſt Box; and ſtill by degrees he mended: and then he deſired another 4 s. Box, and by that time he had taken them, he was able to lie in his Bed, and to walk down out of his Chamber; then being ſo much taken with the Pills, he deſired another Box of</hi> 8 s. <hi>and before that was taken, he was ſo well and lively, that now I do think he is near as ſtrong as ever he was, and I judge there is hardly a ſtronger man in the Pariſh.</hi>

And have given this teſtimony
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93677:147"/>for the encouragement of all perſons that may be troubled with the like diſtemper, to make uſe of the ſame Pills; giving thoſe to underſtand, that in the time of their working, I took but little food beſides broth: And ſo with my true love to thee, I reſt and remain,</hi>

                  <p>☞ Captain <hi>John Pim</hi> of <hi>Hackthorn</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> moſt horribly afflicted with the Dropſie and Scurvy; his Body from the Stomach downwards, Belly, Thighs, Legs and Feet, moſt infinitely ſwelled, ſo that he could not in any meaſure help himſelf; but lay on his back in bed, not able to turn therein, with a weight upon his Stomach to hold down the ſwelling, and to abate the violence of the pain: expecting every hour that his Body would have broke aſunder, the courſe of Nature being almoſt ſtopped, inſomuch that he could not make water, to give the leaſt eaſe. He had given himſelf over for death, and was ſuppoſed by all that that ſaw him to be a dead man, all thinking it uſeleſs for him to make trial of my Pills, though he had by the Poſt ſent for them; but living in ſuch great miſery till they came, he took two; and in few hours after had much eaſe, and received thereby the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93677:147"/>benefit of Nature; he continued taking them every night two at a time for ten days, then took three at a time for ſix weeks together, after which, he could go about his houſe, and did increaſe in ſtrength, to help himſelf in all neceſſary occaſions. He took eight or nine 4 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes before his ſwellings were taken away, by reaſon his Liver, and the reſt of his principal Bowels had received much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage before he had made uſe of my Pills.</p>
                  <p>He had at firſt a very violent Fever; and after that, a Quotidian Ague; then followed a Tertian Ague, attended with a ſuppreſſion of Urine, which was conceived (notwithout good reaſon) to be the Cauſe of the Dropſie. He was alſo girt about with Stitches, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt choaked up with tough flegm, his Spleen much ſwelled and very ſore; with many other infirmities too tedious now to inſert. By ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fourteen 4 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes of my Pills, in few months was reſtored to his former Health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> 24. 1672. I had news brought of a woman near <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> about Forty years of age, that had not been out of her Chamber in ſix years, by reaſon of great weakneſs and pain in her Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by taking two 4 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes of my Pills could walk ſeven miles; and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93677:148"/>ſince by taking a few Boxes more, ſhe is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her perfect health.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman of good worth being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tormented with the Scurvy, and withal a virrulent Gonorrhea, or Running of the Reins, who had for a conſiderable time made uſe of Phyſick, eſpecially Pills cried up for ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; but all proving uſeleſs, he grew vvorſe, and began to ſwell both in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Belly, and Privy Parts, ſo that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded himſelf to be poyſoned, and imagined nothing but death to follovv; but being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvaded to make uſe of my Pills, forthwith ſent for an 8 <hi>s. Box,</hi> and found thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe, and aftervvards for two 4 <hi>s.</hi> Boxes, by which he received a perfect Cure in a ſhort time, with the uſe of a ſmall quantity of the Aſtringent Pills, directed page 199.</p>
                  <p>☞ A Gentlewoman ſorely troubled with the White Flux, great pain and weakneſs in her Back, Ulcers in her Throat and Privy Parts, by taking my Pills every ſecond or third day for one month together, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured. To the Ulcers ſhe made uſe of the Water directed page 96. and the days ſhe took no Purging Pills, ſhe took of the Strengthening Pills before-mentioned, page 199.</p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:93677:148"/>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Pound,</hi> next door to the <hi>Maiden-head</hi> in <hi>St. Johns-ſtreet,</hi> very much ſwelled, who had a great pain and ſtoppage in his Stomach, given over for a dead man, was perfectly cured by my Pills.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>William Virgin</hi> of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Newbury,</hi> violently tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had help by my Pills.</p>
                  <p>Mris. <hi>Elizabeth Rodes,</hi> ſorely afflicted with the Green Sickneſs and Dropſie, received perfect Cure by the foreſaid means.</p>
                  <p>Mris. <hi>Elizabeth Ward</hi> in <hi>Tenter-Ally</hi> in St. <hi>Tooly Street Southwark,</hi> ſore troubled with the Dropſie and Scurvy, much broken out in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, great pain in her Knees and Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe lay exceeding weak for many months, notwithſtanding ſhe had very often made uſe of many able Phyſicians, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and at laſt Cured in a ſhort time, with two or three Boxes of my Pills.</p>
                  <p>About the latter end of <hi>March</hi> 1673. Mr. <hi>Brogden,</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>Horſe-ſhoe</hi> in <hi>Sheer-Lane</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> was cured of the Dropſie with one Box of Pills.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>John Overton</hi> living at the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> in <hi>Grace-Church-Street,</hi> ſorely tormented with the Dropſie and Black Jaundice, was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93677:149"/>perfectly Cured with two or three Boxes of my Pills, and with a ſmall quantity of the Powder directed page 171.</p>
                  <p>Mris. <hi>Brewſter</hi> of <hi>Billericay</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> by reaſon of taking cold in lying in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fell into a violent Dropſie extreamly ſwelled, and withal deprived of the uſe of her Limbs, inſomuch that ſhe was not in the leaſt able to help her ſelf; her Phyſicians and all her Friends leaving her off for a dead wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but accidentally being directed by a worthy Perſon, a Miniſter of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not long before cured by my Pills, to take thereof, was alſo with four or five Boxes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the uſe of her Limbs, and the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie cured, to the admiration of all her Friends.</p>
                  <p>A Merchants Wife of this City being for a long time troubled with a grievous pain and ſtoppage in her Stomach, and had made uſe of ſeveral Medicines, but found no eaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; by making uſe of my Pills, eſpecially three that ſhe took upon the 17th of <hi>May</hi> 1673. which then by vomit cauſed her to void a ſtrange Worm, the Body thereof ſquare, and of a graſs-green colour, the neck round and very white, and the head blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who ſo ſwiftly run about the Baſon, that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93677:149"/>it could hardly be taken, which put the Lady into a great fright; and the next day ſhe ſent it to me: My Counſel was, that ſhe ſhould take more of my Pills; by which ſhe became well, and free from her former pain.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time Mr. <hi>John Phelps,</hi> a Butcher, living near <hi>Redriſſ</hi> Church, being for a long time troubled with a violent pain and ſtoppage in his Stomach, loathed his meat, and was grown ſo weak that he could hardly ſtand, having a reluxation and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in his Joints, attended with grievous pain, himſelf and friends not having the leaſt hopes of his Life. Complaining to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Golden Fleece near to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place, who preſently gave to him five of my Pill, that had lain up and down his houſe in a Box muſty for three or four years, which brought from him by Vomit and Stool abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of filthy corrupt and ſtinking ſlimy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; by which means he became perfectly well in few days, and as ſtrong as ever.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon of good worth, a Merchant, whoſe Name I muſt here conceal, through over-much drinking, eſpecially that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Liquor called Brandy (which, were the truth known, kills more Engliſh-men than the Sword) was moſt terribly afflicted this
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93677:150"/>Summer 1673. with the Dropſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scurvy, Gout and Palſey, having ſuch a Reluxation and Trembling in all his Joints, that he was not able to go without help, had help by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king four 4 s. Boxes of my Pills; and ſince with much joy came to my houſe, and gave me Thanks.</p>
                  <p>Another perſon near the <hi>Strand,</hi> very far gone in the Dropſie, came to my houſe for one Box of <hi>Pills,</hi> by which he was perfectly cured. Not long after <hi>he fell to drink his part of Two or Three Quarts of Brandy, and in few days died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in kindneſs to all <hi>Perſons</hi> that have not an utter diſregard to their own ſafety, by this Example, I do caution, that they do (as much as in them lieth) forbear the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much drinking of Brandy, and other ſtrong Liquors. <hi>For be aſſured upon my long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that under their Conduct marcheth the Dropſie, Scurvy, Conſumption, and other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And were it neceſſary, I could mention hundreds more (ſome of which falling to their old courſe of drinking Brandy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated VVine, have deſtroyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that in all probability might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many years) being perfectly cured of the
